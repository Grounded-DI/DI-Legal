**Deterministic Legal Systems for Safe AI Use in Law**

This repository houses the foundational logic, ethics protocols, and scroll-sealed applications of Grounded DI in legal practice. It includes:

- 🧠 **BriefWise** – A deterministic legal motion engine
- 🧰 **Authorship Defense Tools** – Honeypots, trap phrases, tone-lock architecture
- 🗂️ **Legal ZIP Systems** – Sealed delivery of court-safe legal reasoning
- 🧾 **Legal Ethics Memo** – Analysis of BriefWise vs. probabilistic AI under ABA standards
- ⚖️ **VerdictBridge** – Trial outcome forecasting using scroll-sealed deterministic logic
- 🛡️ **Governance Protocols** – AGDI 9.9, DIA engine, and Scroll 91 authorship control

## 🔍 Why This Matters

Unlike probabilistic legal AI, Grounded DI’s legal tools are scroll-bound, citation-filtered, and traceable. Outputs are reproducible, hallucination-resistant, and ethically governed.

> For truth, tone, and traceability – law deserves better than black boxes.
