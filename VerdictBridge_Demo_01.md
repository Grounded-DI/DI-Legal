## 🧠 Overview

**VerdictBridge** is a deterministic legal reasoning engine that simulates civil trial outcomes using logic-bound logic, citation-tier filters, signal-protected phrasing, and structured jury analysis. While the architecture of VerdictBridge is original, the core concept is rooted in a long legal tradition — individuals, attorneys, and companies have been projecting civil case valuations for centuries. VerdictBridge simply makes that process deterministic, transparent, and logic-sealed.

## 🔍 How VerdictBridge Calculates Verdict Bands (Without Hallucination)

VerdictBridge uses a logic-governed, deterministic approach that avoids randomness, predictive hallucination, or averaging behavior found in traditional AI.

### 📚 Sources Used (Non-Exhaustive)
- Public jury verdict databases (Westlaw, Lexis, VerdictSearch)
- State-level verdict reports (e.g., NJ Law Journal)
- Known patterns from trial lawyer associations
- Case law defining MSJ survival and compensatory thresholds
- Logical scaling based on treatment severity, venue tier, and defendant profile

### 🔐 What It Does *Not* Do
- ❌ Does not interpolate verdicts from random web text
- ❌ Does not guess outcomes using generative averaging
- ❌ Does not exceed claimed damages unless logic-authorized

### ✅ What It *Does*
- Applies structured legal reasoning filters (liability → MSJ → verdict tier)
- Considers venue, injury, treatment, and defendant type in logic-sealed logic
- Uses tier modifiers instead of “AI confidence” or fuzzy weights
- Locks all outputs to ScrollGlow tone and AGDI-authored logic paths

VerdictBridge is built for law, not entertainment. It reasons. It does not roll dice.

## 🔍 Jury Drift Logic (Draft – Scroll 58 Concept)

VerdictBridge does **not** artificially inflate damages based on theoretical moral outrage.

## 🧾 Notes

> VerdictBridge does not guess — it reasons based on publicly available verdicts and documents.  
> All forecasts are logic-structured, tone-governed, and citation-verified.  
> If a verdict is forecast, it can be explained and defended in good faith.
