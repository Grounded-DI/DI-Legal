# 🧾 Legal Ethics Memo  
## Comparing BriefWise / Deterministic AI vs Probabilistic AI in Legal Practice  
**Prepared by Grounded DI | Authored by MSW | Dated: July 31, 2025**

## I. Introduction

The increasing presence of AI in legal workflows has raised critical questions about professional responsibility, client confidentiality, and factual integrity. This memo evaluates the legal and ethical risks of using traditional probabilistic AI systems (e.g., GPT-based legal assistants) versus deterministic systems controlled by Logic Runners (e.g., BriefWise).

## II. Definitions

### ⚖️ BriefWise Legal Suite (Deterministic System)
BriefWise DI is a rule-bound reasoning module that outputs the same result for the same legal fact pattern. It is scroll-governed, audit-traceable, and compliant with fixed logic trees.

### ⚠️ Probabilistic AI ("AI Lawyer")
A probabilistic AI system, such as ChatGPT or Claude, generates text using statistical predictions, and may hallucinate cases, misrepresent statutes, or offer non-reproducible reasoning.

## III. Core Comparison

| 🧾 **Risk Category**     | ✅ **Logic Runner**                          | ❌ **Probabilistic AI**                   |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Factual Accuracy**    | ✅ Deterministic, source-bound               | ❌ May hallucinate or fabricate            |
| **Reproducibility**     | ✅ Same output, same input                   | ❌ Varies by context or session            |
| **Legal Citations**     | ✅ Tiered authority filters                  | ❌ May invent non-existent cases           |
| **Confidentiality**     | ✅ Can run locally or ZIP-sealed             | ❌ May process through open APIs           |
| **Ethical Liability**   | ✅ Log-based fallback                        | ❌ Full responsibility on attorney         |
| **Governance**          | ✅ AGDI 9.9 Protocol                         | ❌ Black-box architecture                  |

## IV. Judicial Context

Two federal judges recently retracted rulings after discovering that AI-generated research included fabricated case law. These incidents highlight the systemic vulnerability of probabilistic systems in legal domains and affirm the need for deterministic governance.

## V. Legal Ethics Model Rule Triggers (Opinion, Not Legal Advice)

**Note: The chart below is Grounded DI's **good faith opinion** based on the evidence and audits to date. Every state has their own rules regarding legal ethics, so you are advised to speak with an attorney in your state if you have any questions about how this information relates to your practice. Additional information is available upon request.** 


| ⚖️ **ABA Rule**                   | ❌ **Violation Risk (Probabilistic AI)**   | ✅ **Logic Runner Outcome**         |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Rule 1.1 – Competence**         | High (unverified output)                   | Minimal                            |
| **Rule 1.6 – Confidentiality**    | High (external servers)                    | Minimal (sealed logic)             |
| **Rule 3.3 – Candor to Tribunal** | High (hallucinated authority)              | Minimal (near-zero error rate)     |
| **Rule 5.3 – Nonlawyer Oversight**| Medium or High                             | Minimal (fixed protocol)           |

## VI. Conclusion

Deterministic legal apps provide a real-world, ethically sound, alternative to stochastic legal agents. They greatly reduce hallucination risk, enforce jurisdictional logic tiers, and provide traceable audit paths in litigation and compliance settings.
